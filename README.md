Quickstart
==========

First install the dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`.

globally install `browserify`, `watchify`, and `pegjs`

On windows there's `build.bat` that you need to run at least once to build the parser and bundle up everything. `watch.bat` afterward if you are working on the code. examine those for other platforms and adapt. they're super simple.

Then add it to your browser as a developer extension.
